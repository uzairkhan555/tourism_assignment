    <H1>TOURISM IN PAKISTAN</H1>
    <P>Tourism in Pakistan has immense potential due to the country’s rich history, diverse cultures, and stunning
        natural landscapes. Unfortunately, security concerns and negative media coverage have deterred many potential
        visitors from exploring this gem of a destination. However, in recent years, the government and tourism industry
        have been working to improve infrastructure and security, and there has been a noticeable increase in tourism.

        Pakistan offers a range of attractions for tourists, from the ancient ruins of the Indus Valley Civilization to
        the majestic mountains of the Himalayas and Karakoram ranges. The country also boasts beautiful beaches,
        deserts, forests, and vibrant cities, each with its own unique character and attractions. Food lovers will also
        appreciate the diverse and delicious cuisine.</P>
